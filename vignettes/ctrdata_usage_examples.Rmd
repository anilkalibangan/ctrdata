# Examples for using R package `ctrdata` for clinical trial protocol-related information

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#
library(ctrdata)
#
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide")
#
# render this document to PDF with this command executed in the vignettes/ folder: 
# Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("ctrdata_examples.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")'
#
if (knitr::opts_knit$get('rmarkdown.pandoc.to') == 'latex') knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = 'pdf')
#
```

General information on the `ctrdata` package is available here: [https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata). 

## Execute a search query and load into database

```{r execute_load_query}
# 
# Load library which has previously been installed:
library(ctrdata)
#
# In the browser, this is a search query used as example: 
# all phase 3 adult breast cancer trials
q <- "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer+AND+breast&age=adult&phase=phase-three"
# 
# Load details on all clinical trials into local data base:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(q)
#
```

## Execute in browser a search query that was previously stored

```{r execute_browser_query}
# 
# The function ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser() can be used to open blank search pages, but 
# also to execute a previous search. This can be used to check if user searches are 
# properly handled by this package, for example by comparing the number of search results.
# 
# Example 1: a search is done in the browser and a list of trials found is shown. 
# Mark all of the browser address field has copy it onto the system clipboard. Then:
q <- ctrGetQueryUrlFromBrowser()  # read search from clipboard
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(q)    # open search newly in broweser
#
# Example 2: After records have already been downloaded: 
q <- ctrQueryHistoryInDb()        # list the searches in the database (returns a data frame)
q <- q [2,]                       # select exactly one of the searches (by subsetting q)
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(q)    # open selected search newly in broweser
#
# This opens a browser already executing an example search:
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(register = "EUCTR", queryterm = "cancer&age=under-18")
#
```


## Find fields / variables of interest

```{r find_variables}
# 
dbFindVariable("date", allmatches = TRUE)
#  [1] "firstreceived_date"                                                               
#  [2] "lastchanged_date"                                                                 
#  [3] "required_header.download_date"

#  [5] "start_date"                                                                       
#  [6] "primary_completion_date"

# [...]
#
```

## Update data base from query in specified register

```{r execute_update_query}
#
# List queries:
ctrQueryHistoryInDb()
# 
# 
# Update query number 1 in the history:
#  - EUCTR information can be incrementally downloaded or updated only
#    for the last 7 days, after which a full new download is necessary. 
#  - CTGOV intformation can always be incrementally downloaded or updated. 
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(querytoupdate = 1)
#
ctrQueryHistoryInDb()
# Note: after such an update, the column "query-records" refers 
# to the number of records that were added or updated, only, 
# when the update was run as per the "query-timestamp", 
# not to the total number of records. 
#
#
# The date and time of the last download of individual records
# is stored in the variable "record_last_import" as follows: 
resultDate <- dbGetVariablesIntoDf("record_last_import")
lastUpdate <- strptime(resultDate$record_last_import, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
summary(lastUpdate)
#                  Min.               1st Qu.                Median  [...]
# "2016-04-21 19:49:54" "2016-04-21 19:49:54" "2016-04-21 19:49:54"  [...] 
#
```


## Deduplicate country-specific records of a trial, visualise trial information

Note EUCTR provides country-specific records for trials, see README.md. 

```{r deduplicate_visualise_euctr}
#
# Example 1: Relation between number of study participants in one country and in whole trial? 
#
result <- dbGetVariablesIntoDf(c("f41_in_the_member_state", "f422_in_the_whole_clinical_trial"))
#
if(interactive()) plot(f41_in_the_member_state ~ f422_in_the_whole_clinical_trial, result)
# [result not shown]
# 
#
# Example 2: How many clinical trials are ongoing or completed, per country?
#
result <- dbGetVariablesIntoDf(c("a1_member_state_concerned", "x5_trial_status"))
#
if(interactive()) with (result, table(a1_member_state_concerned, x5_trial_status))
# [result not shown]
#
# 
# Example 3: How many clinical trials where started in which year?
#
result <- dbGetVariablesIntoDf(c("a1_member_state_concerned", 
                                 "n_date_of_competent_authority_decision", 
                                 "a2_eudract_number"))
#
# Eliminate trials records duplicated by member state: 
result <- dfFindUniqueEuctrRecord(result)
# 1781 EUCTR records dropped that were not the preferred of multiple records for the trial.
#
# Visualise:
result$startdate <- strptime(result$n_date_of_competent_authority_decision, "%Y-%m-%d")
hist(result$startdate, breaks = "years", freq = TRUE, las = 1); box()
#
```

## Download from another register, check for duplicates, merge variables and re-organise values 

```{r execute_ctgov_query}
#
# Get data from another register: 
#
# Ongoing phase 3 interventional trials in breast carcinoma
q <- "https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=&recr=Open&type=Intr&cond=breast+carcinoma&intr=Drug&state1=&age=1&phase=2"
#
# Show and check search in browser: 
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(q)
#
# Load data: 
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(q)
# ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(queryterm = "ependymoma&recr=Open&type=Intr&age=0", register = "CTGOV")
#
# Data from which queries have now been downloaded into the database?

# 
# Get columns from the database from different registers
# (takes some time as variables are merged one after the other):

                                 "x5_trial_status", 
                                 "a2_eudract_number"))
#
# Find ids of unique trials and subset the result set to these unique trials:
ids_of_unique_trials <- dbFindIdsUniqueTrials()
# Searched for EUCTR identifiers in second id fields of CTGOV records.
# Searched for CTGOV identifiers in second id fields of CTGOV records.
# Total 24 duplicate(s) found, returning keys (_id) of 2513 records.
#
# Subset the result set to these unique trials:
result <- subset (result, subset = `_id` %in% ids_of_unique_trials)
#
# Select one Member State's version of an internactional trial:
result <- dfFindUniqueEuctrRecord(result)
# 1766 EUCTR records dropped that were not the preferred of multiple records for the trial.
#
# Now merge two variables into a new variable for analysis:
tmp <- dfMergeTwoVariablesRelevel(result, 
                                  varnames = c("overall_status", "x5_trial_status"))
# Unique values returned: Ongoing, Completed, Prematurely Ended, Temporarily Halted, 
#  Restarted, Recruiting, Not yet recruiting
#
table(tmp)
# Active, not recruiting    Completed   Enrolling by invitation  [...] 
#                     812        2572                        29  [...]

#
# Merge two variables as above and in addition, 
# condense their values into a new value:
statusvalues <- list("ongoing" = c("Recruiting", "Active", "Ongoing", 
                                   "Active, not recruiting",

                    "other"     = c("Withdrawn", "Suspended", "No longer available", 
                                    "Not yet recruiting", "Temporarily Halted"))

                                  varnames = c("overall_status", "x5_trial_status"), 
                                  levelslist = statusvalues)
# Unique values returned: ongoing, completed, other
#
table(tmp)
# completed   ongoing     other 
#       159       671       115
#
```

## Use another mongo package for analysis, for example to count sites per trial

Note: Packages to access mango such as `mongolite` or `RMongo` may work to access data that are already in the dababase. However, package `rmongodb` is still necessary to retrieve data from registers and to store these data into the database. 

```{r mongolite_count_details}
#
library(mongolite)
#
m <- mongo(db = "users", collection = "ctrdata")
# 
# Check if there are any duplicates:
ids_of_unique_trials <- dbFindIdsUniqueTrials()
# Searched for EUCTR identifiers in second id fields of CTGOV records.
# Searched for CTGOV identifiers in second id fields of CTGOV records.
# Total 24 duplicate(s) found, returning keys (_id) of 2513 records.
#
# Find the database elements that represent a site:
out <- m$find('{}', '{"location.facility.name": 1}')
#
# If there were duplicates, the unique trials could be retained like this:
out <- subset (out, subset = `_id` %in% ids_of_unique_trials)
#
# Define a helper function to count elements, irrespective of whether
# the elements are in an array or are a set of subdocuments in the database:
count.elements <- function (dataframecolumn) {
   return(sapply(dataframecolumn, 
                 function(x) ifelse (is.data.frame(tmp <- unlist (x[[1]])), 
                                     nrow(tmp), length(tmp))))
}
#
# Sum up number of sites per trial:
out$number_of_sites <- count.elements (out$location)
#
# Inspect first rows:
out[1:5,]
#                 _id                                      location  number_of_sites
# 1       NCT00097292  Children's Hospital LA, UCSF, Stanford [...]               21
# 2       NCT00129259                   The Diabetes Center at UCSF                1
# 3 2006-001238-41-IT                                          NULL                0
#
# For many trials, no locations seem to be specified:
out <- out [out$number_of_sites >= 1 & out$number_of_sites <50, ]
#
# Draw histogram:
hist (out$number_of_sites)
#
```

## Plot frequency of certain end points

```{r plot_endpoint_frequencies}
#
# Search for interesting variables,  
# note the spelling in EUCTR:
dbFindVariable("end_point", allmatches = TRUE)
#
# Get interesting variables from database 
# for further analysis within R:

#

# The following uses the aggregation pipeline in mongo:
#
# Count number of records in which certain terms occur,
# in any of the elements of the array in primary_outcome. 
# Regular expressions ("$regex") are case insensitive ("i")
#
# Recommendation: to best define regular expressions for analyses, 
# inspect the field primary_outcome.measure in data base, or print:
m$distinct("primary_outcome.measure", query = '{"_id": {"$regex": "NCT[0-9]{8}"}}')
#
# PFS, EFS, RFS or DFS

## Using mapreduce operations to analyse participant numbers

Note that the mongodb documentation includes that a mapreduce operation might not be as fast and efficient as using the aggregation pipeline, which was used in the preceding example. 

```{r mongodb_mapreduce}
#
library(mongolite)
#
m <- mongo(db = "users", collection = "ctrdata")
#
# Count number of trials (trial records) with number of study participants 
# in bins of hundreds of participants:
#
hist <- m$mapreduce(
#
  map = "function(){emit(Math.floor(this.f422_in_the_whole_clinical_trial/100)*100, 1)}", 
  #
  reduce = "function(id, counts){return Array.sum(counts)}"
  #
)
#
hist
#      _id value
# 1    NaN  5364
# 2      0   344
# 3    100   183
# 4    200    79
# 5    300   102
# 6    400    78
#
# note: _id is the bin of hundreds of study participants, 
# value is the number of studies in respective bin
# 
plot (hist, type = "h", las = 1, xlim = c(0, 2000), ylim = c(0, 500), 
      xlab = "Number stubjects", y = "Number trials")
#
```
