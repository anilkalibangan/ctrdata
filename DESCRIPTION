Description: Provides functions for querying and retrieving information on clinical trials from two public registers, the European Union Clinical Trials Register ("EUCTR", https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/) and ClinicalTrials.gov ("CTGOV", https://clinicaltrials.gov/). The information is transformed and then stored in a database (mongo). Functions are provided for accessing and analysing the locally stored information on the clinical trials, as well as for identifying duplicate records. The package is motivated by the wish for aggregating and trend-analysing clinical trial design and conduct.
