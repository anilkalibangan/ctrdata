Description: Provides functions for querying and retrieving
    information on clinical trials from two public registers, the European Union
    Clinical Trials Register ("EUCTR", https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/) and
    ClinicalTrials.gov ("CTGOV", https://clinicaltrials.gov/). The information is
    transformed and then stored in a database (mongo). Functions are provided for
    accessing and analysing the locally stored information on the clinical trials,
    as well as for identifying duplicate records. The package is motivated
    by the wish for aggregating and trend-analysing clinical trial design and conduct.
