Description: The package provides functions for querying and retrieving
    information on clinical trials from two public registers, the European Union
    Clinical Trials Register ("EUCTR", https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/) and
    ClinicalTrials.gov ("CTGOV", https://clinicaltrials.gov/). The information is
    transformed so that it can be locally stored in a database (mongo). Functions
    are provided for accessing and analysing the locally stored information on the
    clinical trials, and for identifying duplicate records. The package is motivated
    by the wish for aggregating and trend analysing clinical trials.
